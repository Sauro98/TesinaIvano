Backup for high school final project

<b>General info<b>
I'm trying to implement a ZIP/DEFLATE compressor and decompressor that will allow users to crypt their compressed files
- light crypting with DES
- heavy crypting with 3DES

<b>Current status: <b>
<ul>
  <li>Des crypter working fine</li>
  <li>Huffman coding (original style) working fine</li>
  <li>LZ77 (original version) working fine</li>
  <li>Huffman coding (DEFLATE version) work in progress</li>
  <li>LZ77 (DEFLATE version) yet to start</li>
 </ul>
